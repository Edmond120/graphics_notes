Image File Formats Raster vs. Vector Vector formats represent images as a series of drawing instructions.  Infinitely scalable.  SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) Raster formats represent images as a grid of pixels.

	Uncompressed vs. Compressed (Raster)

		Uncompressed formats contain data for each pixel.

			BMP,TIFF,RAW

		Compressed formats use a compression algorithm to minimize file size.

		Lossless vs. Lossy

			Lossless compression algorithms contain enough information to exactly 
			recreate the original image.
		
				PNG (Portable Network Graphics). GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)

			Lossy compression algorithms do not retain all the details of the original
			image

				JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)

		PPM (Portable PixMap)

			Uncompressed raster format.

			Pixel data is represented by RGB triplets in either ASCII or binary.

			All whitespace is equivalent.

			example file:

				P3 							file type
				4 3							width, height
				255							max color value (will be scaled)
				<pixels with one whitespace between each value>
