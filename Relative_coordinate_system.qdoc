{Relative Coordinate System}:

-	Currently transformations are applied to all
	the shapes in an image.
-	In a R.C.S. we can apply transformations to individual
	or groups of shapes.
-	Transformations will be applied to the "world" or
	current coordinate system.

Drawing in a R.C.S. :
-	1)  Generate the polygons/edger
-	2)  Apply the current coordinate system to those
		points
-	3)  Draw the polygons/edges to the image (screen)

	`#	basically push/pop matrix in processing
