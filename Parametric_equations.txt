Parametric Equations:
	Define curves as systems of equations with a single independent
	variable(t).

		x = f(t)
		y =	g(t)

	For consistency, we will use the range [0,1] for t.

	General Parametric Framework:
		```
		for t:theta - 1, t += step
			x=f(t)
			y=g(t)
		
		add(x,y)
		```

	Circle r (xc,yc):
		```
		x=f(t) = rcos(2(pi)t) + xc
		y=g(t) = rsin(2(pi)t) + yc
		```

	Splines:
	-	Curves that can be connected smoothly
	-	We are only using cubic spines
